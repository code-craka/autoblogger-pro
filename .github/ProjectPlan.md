## Progress Tracking Methods

### 1. Automated Tracking

#### Code-Based Metrics
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow for Progress Tracking
name: Progress Tracking
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  track-progress:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Calculate Completion
        run: |
          # Count completed tasks by checking merged PRs with task tags
          COMPLETED=$(git log --oneline --grep="Task:" --since="1 month ago" | wc -l)
          TOTAL=$(grep -r "Task.*:" docs/tasks/ | wc -l)
          PERCENTAGE=$((COMPLETED * 100 / TOTAL))
          echo "Project Completion: ${PERCENTAGE}%"
```

#### Test Coverage Integration
```bash
# Automated test coverage tracking

## Adaptive Planning Strategies

### 1. Agile Planning Adjustments

#### Sprint Flexibility Buffer
- **Reserve 20% capacity** for unexpected changes or blockers
- **Maintain backlog** of small tasks that can fill capacity gaps
- **Plan for technical debt** addressing in each sprint

#### Epic Pivoting Strategy
If an epic becomes unviable or priorities shift:
1. **Assess Completion**: Determine what can be salvaged
2. **User Value**: Identify minimum viable deliverable
3. **Technical Debt**: Plan for cleanup of incomplete work
4. **Communication**: Update stakeholders on changes and rationale

### 2. Risk Response Planning

#### Technical Risk Mitigation
```yaml
Risk Categories:
  Integration_Failures:
    Probability: Medium
    Impact: High
    Mitigation: 
      - Proof of concept development
      - Fallback provider implementation
      - Early integration testing
  
  Performance_Issues:
    Probability: Low
    Impact: High
    Mitigation:
      - Load testing in each sprint
      - Performance budgets
      - Monitoring and alerting
  
  Third_Party_Dependencies:
    Probability: High
    Impact: Medium
    Mitigation:
      - Multiple provider support
      - Vendor risk assessment
      - Contract negotiations
```

#### Market Risk Responses
- **Competitive Response**: Accelerate development or pivot features
- **Market Shift**: Reassess product-market fit and adjust roadmap
- **Economic Downturn**: Focus on core value proposition and unit economics
